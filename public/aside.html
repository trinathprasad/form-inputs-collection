  The Lost Scroll
The desert wind, carrying the scent of dust and spices, whipped around Maya as she hurried through the bustling streets of Jaipur. Today was the day she had been waiting for – the day she would finally unveil the ancient scroll her grandfather had entrusted to her. She had been tasked with finding the perfect place to display it, a place that would honor its history.
She had chosen the rooftop of her family's old haveli, a place that overlooked the city's vibrant heart. As she reached the top, a sudden gust of wind snatched the scroll from her hands, sending it tumbling down the steps and into the courtyard below. Maya watched in horror as the scroll landed in a pile of dust and debris.
A young boy, no older than eight, approached her cautiously, his eyes wide with curiosity. He picked up the scroll, carefully brushing off the dust. "This is beautiful," he whispered, his voice filled with wonder. Maya smiled, relieved that the scroll had landed in kind hands. "It is indeed," she replied, "And it tells a story of our city, of our ancestors." She knew then that the scroll's journey had just begun, and that its story would continue to be told, in the heart of Jaipur.The Lost Scroll
